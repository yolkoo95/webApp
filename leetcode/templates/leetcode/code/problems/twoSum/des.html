<h2>Two Sum</h2>
<div class="details">
  <p>
    Given an array of integers, return indices of the two numbers such that they
    add up to a specific target.
  </p>
  <p>
    You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may
    not use the same element twice.
  </p>

<code>
  Example: Given nums = [2, 7, 11, 15], target = 9,

  <br />Because nums[0] + nums[1] = 2 + 7 = 9, <br />return [0, 1].
