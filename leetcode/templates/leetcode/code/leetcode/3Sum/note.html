    Simlar like "Two Number" problem, we can have the simlar solution.
</p>
<p>
    Suppose the input array is S[0..n-1], 3SUM can be solved in O(n^2) time on average by 
inserting each number S[i] into a hash table, and then for each index i and j,  
checking whether the hash table contains the integer - (s[i]+s[j])
</p>

    Alternatively, the algorithm below first sorts the input array and then tests all 
possible pairs in a careful order that avoids the need to binary search for the pairs 
in the sorted list, achieving worst-case O(n^n)
